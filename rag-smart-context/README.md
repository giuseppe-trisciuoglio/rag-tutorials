# Smart Context Management
This tutorial shows how to build a **Smart Context** using the RAG System.
## Introduction
Smart Context Management is a key feature of the RAG System. 
It allows to manage the context of the user in a smart way. 
The context is a set of information that describes the user's environment. 
The context can be used to provide personalized services to the user. 
For example, the context can be used to provide recommendations to the user based on his/her preferences.
